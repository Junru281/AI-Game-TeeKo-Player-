Welcome! üòÅ

This is a AI TeeKo player Samaritan applying minimax algorithm.


### What is TeeKo? ###
TeeKo is a game between two players on a 5*5 board. Each player has **four** markers denoting as ***r*** for red and ***b*** for black. 

**Begining with black**, two players **take turns** to placing markers (the "drop phase") until all markers are on the board. If after the drop phase, neither player has won, they continue ***move one marker at a time to an adjacent spot only*** (including left, right, up, down and diagonals one spot) until one player wins.

**The final goal** is to get four markers with the same color in a row horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. 

## How to start the game? ##
Download the game.py file and run it in a IDE or python3 game.py in your terminal. 

## How to interpret the board? ##
As you can see from the picture above, a position is composed of a vertical and horizontal character. For instance, B4, C1 are all valid positions.
